# Google-Playstore-Apps-rating-Predictions

Introduction

The google play store is one of the largest and most popular Android app stores. It has
an enormous amount of data that can be used to make an optimal model. We have
used araw data set of Google Play Store from the Kaggle website.This data set
contains 13 different features that can be used for predicting whether an app will be
successful or not using different features. This data set is scraped from the Google
Play Store. This journal talks about different classifier models that we used for
prediction purposes and finding which one gives the highest accuracy. This journal
also gives detailed information on feature extraction and the complete Data
visualization done on this data set.


Datasets

The dataset taken is of Google play store application and is taken from Kaggle ,
which is the world‟s largest community for data scientists to explore ,analyze and
share data. This dataset is for Web scratched information of 10k Play Store
applications to analyze the market of android. Here it is a downloaded dataset which a
user can use to examine the Android market of different use of classifications music,
camera etc. With the assistance of this, client can predict see whether any given
application will get lower or higher rating level. This dataset can be moreover used
for future references for the proposal of any application. Additionally, the
disconnected dataset is picked so as to choose the estimate exactly as online data gets
revived all around a great part of the time. With the assistance of this dataset I will
examine various qualities like rating, free or paid

Columns - Apps, Categories, Rating, Review, Size, Installs, Types, Price,
Content Rating, Current Version, Android Version, Last Update.


Objectives

The main goal of this project is to analyze different attributes of given application like
application name, category, rating, reviews, size, installs, type, price, content rating,
genres, last updated, current version, android version. And to find out the most rated
and most reviewed apps and also to distinguish between the apps which are either free
or paid.

Python

Most of the info scientist use python due to the good built-in library functions and
therefore the decent community. Python now has 70,000 libraries. Python is
simplest programing language to select up compared to other language. That’s the
most reason data scientists use python more often, for machine learning and data
processing data analyst want to use some language which is straightforward to
use. That’s one among the most reasons to use python. Specifically, for data
scientist the foremost popular data inbuilt open source library is named panda. As
we've seen earlier in our previous assignment once we got to plot scatter plot, heat
maps, graphs, 3-dimensional data python built-in library comes very helpful.
